# ACC - Android Chroot Container

`ACC` is a script that provides a lightweight and minimal chroot environment for rooted Android devices. It manages an isolated, native Linux-like userland without depending on Termux or additional user-space layers. It's ideal for power users, developers, and tinkerers who want to run a sandboxed Linux environment as close to the actual Android system.

## Features

- Small and portable.
- Runs a minimal Linux userland in a safe chroot environment.
- Mounts key Android system paths to provide near-native Linux functionality.
- Employs `unshare` to sandbox file system changes from the host Android system.
- Requires no `Termux` or user-space layers.

## Requirements

- A rooted Android device.
- A Linux filesystem tarball.
- An Android Terminal Emulator.
- A compatible busybox binary with:
  - ln
  - cp
  - chmod
  - mkdir
  - true
  - chroot
  - unshare
  - hostname
  - basename
  - mount
  - umount
  - mountpoint

## Installation Guide

Recommended applications:

- [BusyBox](apk/BusyBox.apk)
- [Terminal Emulator](apk/TerminalEmulator.apk)
- [Hacker's Keyboard](apk/HackersKeyboard.apk)
- [Root Explorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.speedsoftware.rootexplorer&hl=en-US)

The installation guide assumes only basic knowledge the Android system like installing files from unknown sources and minimal CLI experience.

### Busybox

For convenience, the project includes the free version of [Stericson's BusyBox Installer APK](apk/BusyBox.apk) and a pre-built standalone busybox binary for aarch64 ([Found Here!](bin/busybox)). Novice users are encouraged to use the graphical installer for simplicity. Both methods install the same version: `BusyBox v1.32.0-Stericson`. Alternatively, locate a compatible busybox binary that supports the above commands.

## Linux Filesystem Tarball

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure you are looking for pre-installed **ARM** (aarch64) linux rootfs packaged within a tarball archive (`*.tar.gz`), not live installers (`*.iso`), which are flashed onto installation medias like CDs and USBs.

Download your preferred Linux filesystem tarball to the systemâ€™s `Download` folder. For convienience, the projects includes a collection of compatible systems under [rootfs](rootfs). Next, open your terminal emulator and run the following commands:

```bash
# Acquire root permissions
su

# Remount /data for writing
mount -o remount,rw /data

# Create and populate the chroot folder
mkdir -p /data/linux/$ENV_NAME_HERE
tar -xfv /sdcard/Download/$TARBALL_NAME_HERE -C /data/linux/$ENV_NAME_HERE

# Remount back /data as read-only
mount -o remount,ro /data
```

## ACC

Use a file explorer that can access the root filesystem and can remount `/system` as read-write, such as Root Explorer. Copy the `acc` script into `/system/bin` or any location accessible through `$PATH`.  Alternatively keep it under `/sdcard/acc` and invoke it as:

```bash
su && sh /sdcard/acc /data/linux/$ENV_NAME_HERE
```

## Usage

```txt
acc: A lightweight utility to create safe, isolated chroot environments.
Usage: bin/acc <environment> <command> <command-args>
```

Inside the chroot shell, users can execute the `exit` command to leave the environment and automatically unmount the filesystems.

## Known Issues

- Arch Linux is currently unsupported due to unresolved `gnupg` issues.
- On some systems, non-root users may lack permission to run Linux binaries. If your system supports user-space isolation, you can use `unshare` with the `--user --map-root-user` options.
